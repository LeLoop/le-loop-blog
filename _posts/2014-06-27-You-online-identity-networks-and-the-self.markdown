title: You, online, identity, networks, and the self
author: tom
summary: "A talk about online surveillance and big data."
---

I'm on a speaking tour through Europe and in my love for hacker spaces
around the globe I stopped by Le Loop yesterday and had a blast. I was able
to confirm a date with ToM to hold an event this weekend. This talk will be
in English (I don't know French) but discussion in any language is
encouraged. Here's some more information:

* Date: Saturday, 28th June 2014
* Time: 4pm - 6pm
* Location: [Le Loop](/where.html) 20 rue de Reuilly, Paris

In the current landscape of media and communication, our world is
undergoing immense and rapid transformations in the breadth, and format of
how we interconnect. At the same time, it is difficult for even the most
technically adept to fully comprehend the scope of these projects. This
talk is a musing on the ideas behind online identity and mass communication
in the 21st century. It intends to partially unravel the mystery behind
networked social identity, as well as provide the tools for even the
technically-disinclined to understand the possibilities for control,
surveillance, freedom, and liberated identity within this new topology.

Some included topics:

* Online surveillance, and how deleting your Facebook isn’t enough
* Big Data analytics: why your data is worth money, and the (im)possibility
of privacy
* Theories and Paradoxes in a hyper-connected future
* Alternative internets, (or darkness) and what they represent.
